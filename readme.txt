**Where does BackupMyWordpress store the data?**

Backups are stored in the cloud accessible from BackupMyWordpress.net.

Through our website you can obtain the latest backup you have stored for free.

For our premium customers we offer the following additional advantages:
* All backups replicated to at least 2 different locations
* One Year history of backups
* AES256 Encryption Enabled

**How do I restore my site from a backup?**

As this plugin is simply an extension to BackupWordpress the process is basically the same.

After obtaining the backup you wish to restore from BackupMyWordpress.net, `Unzip` the files and upload all the files to your server overwriting your site. You can then import the database using your hosts database management tool (likely `phpMyAdmin`).

See this guide for more details - [How to restore from backup](https://bwp.hmn.md/support-center/restore-backup/ "Go to support center").
